About put.io
---------------------------------------

put.io is a storage service that fetches media files (from various sources) and lets you stream them immediately. You can use it to stream video, listen to your music and share your library with friends. Your files are always a few touches away within various devices and software.

This addon uses put.io's publicly available API which is written in Python. Despite I'm a put.io developer, it's not officially supported by put.io and therefore any issues should be reported as a ticket in github repository.

About XBMC
---------------------------------------

XBMC is an open source media center software which runs on most major platforms and is able to play nearly all media formats. It can stream from various sources by itself or through third party addons (written in Python) which can be downloaded from its repositories.

Installation
---------------------------------------

You need to have an api key & secret pair belonging to an active put.io account in order to use this addon. After installation, you should go to its settings and enter those information into the related fields.

Because of its rapid development, this addon will remain in github for a while. Until then, just copying the 'plugin.video.putio' directory under XBMC's addon directory should be enough. When it becomes stable I plan to place this addon in the official repository.
